# Titanic Data Analysis & ML

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

This project involves examining Titanic survival data provided by Kaggle. We examine the survival rates of different groups of passengers and identify which characteristics led
to the highest survival rate. In addition to this we apply ML techniques to predict which passengers survived the disaster.
